# Car_Price_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning

Car price prediction using machine learning involves building models that can estimate the price of a car based on various features and characteristics. By leveraging historical car data, machine learning algorithms can learn patterns and relationships between different attributes of cars and their corresponding prices.

The process typically involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gathering a comprehensive dataset that includes information about car features such as make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, engine size, transmission type, number of previous owners, and other relevant factors.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. This step may also involve feature engineering, where new meaningful features are derived from the existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.

Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features that have the most impact on car prices. This helps reduce dimensionality and improve model efficiency and accuracy.

Model Selection: Choosing an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem's characteristics and available data. Commonly used algorithms for car price prediction include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks.

Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to train the chosen model. The model learns the relationships between the features and the target variable, which, in this case, is the car price.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), or R-squared (RÂ²) to measure how well the model fits the data.

Model Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is obtained, it can be deployed to predict car prices on new, unseen data. This can be done through creating an API, a web application, or integrating it into an existing system.
